# Explanation
- I have build a simple `Person` component that displays information about a person.
- I will use state to manage the person's age and props to pass the person's name as a property.
- In `Person.js` file, I define a functional component named Person.
- It takes `props` as a parameter, which allows us to pass data into the component.
- The `useState` hook is used to manage the person's age.
- The `increaseAge` function increments the age when the button is clicked and the `decreaseAge` function decrements the age when the button is clicked.
